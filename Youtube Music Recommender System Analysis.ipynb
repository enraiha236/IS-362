    "## 1. Who are the target users?\n",
    "\n",
    "From YouTube’s organizational perspective, the target users include all the platform’s viewers, especially those who use YouTube Music. This spans a huge base: free users, people who watch music videos on YouTube, and premium subscribers who use YouTube Music specifically. Because YouTube is both a video and audio platform, many users cross between watching and listening, so the recommender must serve very different consumption modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the viewer's perspective, the target user is someone who wants both music discovery and playback flexibility. This could be a regular music listener who uses YouTube Music for audio-only listening, or a fan who watches official music videos, live performances, lyric videos, or visualizers. It also includes people who use YouTube in a more casual way but end up finding new artists or songs through recommendations."

    "## 2. What are their key goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "From YouTube’s point of view, users’ key goals are to find content that keeps them engaged. For music, that means recommending tracks or videos that match their tastes, but also surfacing content that can lead to more watch time or re-engagement. YouTube wants to maximize both immediate engagement and long-term satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the listener’s perspective, their goals vary depending on context and mood. Sometimes they want background music for work or commuting. Other times they are in discovery mode and want to find new artists or songs they never knew. Because YouTube supports both video and audio music experiences, users may also want to explore live performances, visual content, or deep cuts. They need recommendations that balance what they know with what they might like next."

    "## 3. How does the recommender system help them accomplish their goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Music Tomorrow article, YouTube Music’s system uses two complementary approaches to understand content. One is content-based filtering: the system analyzes the audio, video visuals, titles, descriptions, and tags for each piece of content to build a representation of what that video is about. The other is collaborative filtering: it looks at how users behave to find relationships between videos, learning which ones are often watched by the same people.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the user side, YouTube models listeners using three major data types. First, it uses long-term watch history to understand their general tastes in music, artists, and styles. Second, it monitors short-term session behavior to infer context and intent — for example, whether you are watching for work, for fun, or for a particular mood. Third, it includes demographic and environmental context (device, location, time of day) to further refine predictions."

    "# Reverse Engineering the Youtube Music Recommender System\n",
    "To reverse engineer YouTube Music, I am examining the app interface and comparing it with the Music Tomorrow guide. When I use the app, I notice that recommended songs and videos often share similar moods, production styles, or artist relationships with what I recently played. This indicates that content-based filtering, including audio and video analysis along with metadata, plays a strong role.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Daily Mixes and recommended radio playlists in the app tend to cluster songs that align with my listening habits, showing that collaborative filtering is also heavily used. The system appears to weigh both short-term session behavior and long-term listening history, as certain recommendations change depending on what I recently played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app also shows hints of ranking and candidate selection: broad pools of potentially relevant content are filtered down and scored based on user engagement features like watch duration, likes, and replays. Post-filtering rules ensure variety, so I do not see too many consecutive songs from the same artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing skips, likes, and playlist additions in the app, I can see how the system continuously updates its recommendations. Songs I skip quickly appear less frequently, while tracks I save or repeat influence future recommendations, aligning with the Music Tomorrow description of YouTube Music’s adaptive and multi-stage recommendation pipeline."

    "# Recommendations for Improving YouTube Music’s Recommender System\n",
    "One improvement would be increasing transparency by giving users the option to view or adjust the features influencing their recommendations. Allowing users to mark certain genres, moods, or artists as “not interested” could help reduce unwanted content that appears because of cross platform signals from YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another improvement would involve refining the interaction between YouTube and YouTube Music histories. Sometimes a user’s recommendations are influenced by unrelated YouTube activity such as watching gaming or news videos. Separating music specific signals from general video consumption could make recommendations more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third improvement could focus on short term personalization. While YouTube Music reacts to engagement, it sometimes takes longer than expected to adapt to shifts in the user’s mood or context. Stronger real time session based modeling could help the system more accurately capture what the user wants right now."
